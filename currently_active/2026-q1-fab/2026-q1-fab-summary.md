# Fabricate

The next round of work on Fabricate includes extracting all of the code from SLink into the various library projects including. 

i_cli.ts.adligo.org <br/>
cli.ts.adligo.org <br/>
cli_tests.ts.adligo.org <br/>
i_fs.ts.adligo.org <br/>
fs.ts.adligo.org <br/>
fs_tests.ts.adligo.org <br/>
etc (about 20 projects)

This can be done in the slink_bm.ts.adligo.org project or the fab_bm.ts.adligo.org project as they share many projects.

The fab_bm.ts.adligo.org is likely currently broken due to upgrades in slink_bm.ts.adligo.org this week.
